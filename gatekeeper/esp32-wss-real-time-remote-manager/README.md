## Gatekeeper (HÃ¡zmester) - "esp32-wss-real-time-remote-manager"
### Secure Remote Real-time Digital and Analog I/O on ESP32-S3 using HTTPS+WSS (SSL/TLS and Secure WebScoket).

PlatformIO was tried, but the development is in the original espressif esp-idf framework.

How to build (//TODO):
1. Copy ./sdkconfig.sX.template --> ./sdkconfig (X=2 or 3 for the ESP32-S2 or ESP32-S3 board versions, respectively)
2. Patch files in the framework that you can find in the ./patches folder.
3. Build the project
